## Why microapps
After many years of web development, testing of frameworks, trying Angular 1, React, Preact, Vuejs, Solid, Astra, Svelte, and some that I'm forgetting, I'm ready to jump off the frameworks bandwagen, and just focus on building microapps, with only minimal or maybe no frameworks.

What was the last straw? Upgrading Svlete 4 to 5 was painful, especially when I couldn't really see the advantages of the new system. Moving from Angular 1 to 2 was impossible. Seeing the size of React bundles. 

## What are microapps?
Maybe there's no good definition yet, but I'm betting that the name resonates with more than a few. It means small apps, that do one, or at least a limited set of things, well, with no complexity or overhead. Small and beautiful, scalable, the 100 year app that will always work. Zero, or very few, dependencies. It runs well, small codebase, does its thing, with no fireworks or false promises. No hype, just stability, speed and functionality. That's it. Back to the roots.
