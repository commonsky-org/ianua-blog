title: The Limits of Feature-Driven-Development
description: SaaS products are becoming ever more complex, unwieldly, and just plain anti-user, focusing more on up-selling than fulfilling user's needs. Is the SaaS software model toppling under its own weight?

I have the feeling that the current SaaS-driven software model is suffering majorly from [featuritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep), and is becoming increasingly annoying, unsustainable, and just plain anti-user. Every time a new and useful web tool becomes available, with one or two extremely useful features, it feels great. It's getting a gift, a solution to a common problem, easily and accessibly in the browser.

However the joy is usually short-lived. Very quickly the tool first gets a sign-in page, with a survey for customer acquisition purposes, before the user can actually just use the tool. Then the feature-flood begins, with quantity clearly emphasized over quality, and lots of AI nonsense, with hidden up-sell "gotchas" at every turn. I just want an effective tool! Simplicity and elegance are clearly not in vogue at the moment.
