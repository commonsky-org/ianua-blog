Planet Apps is an initiative for a better integration of open technologies & knowledge with commercial interests & platforms. We propose to make a clear distinction between software & knowledge assets, which should be open technologies, and commercial distribution channels, which can offer many methods of access and convenience for different price points. This would incentivize commercial platform providers to innovate on service, efficiency, speed, & bundling instead of moats & lock-in techniques.

## The Planet Apps Manifesto
- We hold that knowledge & software assets should be **open technologies**, with few exceptions. That means software assets are licensed with GPL or LGPL only, and media content with Creative Commons. Commercial models should only be used for providing better ways to access, consume and use the assets, for example through SaaS hosting, printed or e-books and media, or other ways for users to more easily consume, use and benefit from the technology and information.
- We pledge to the responsible use of energy & resources. Compute, and the energy & water needed to power it, are finite, and service providers, for example SaaS or information providers, have the responsibility to use clever methods of delivering passive services, meaning scale-to-zero when not being used, and not wasting resources on useless, fancy features for marketing & sales purposes only.
- We pledge to only offer up-sells ONLY for the better running and operating of the services (higher reliability, support, speed, etc..), and NOT for more features. All features should always be available in all versions, and also to self-host, because software & knowledge assets should be open technologies, as outlined in point 1. Commercial models are only for the bundling, running and operating of the services, in ever more convenient, innovative & reliable ways, not for extra proprietary features that lock users into a particular provider.
